## Overview

This project is a movie app that can check the latest movies based on categories. And in this first version of the project I'm setting up the server of the movie app and create the basic structures.

## Getting Started

 The steps that you must take on your terminal in order to build this app on your own machine and get it running:

 1. Clone this repository
 2. Run ***npm init -y***
 3. Run ***npm install***
 4. Run ***npm start*** in order to start the server running.

## Project Features

I configured a Home Page Endpoint localhost:3000/ this page initially displays information about the movie.

I configured a Favorite Page Endpoint localhost:3000/favorite this page initially displays information about the movie "Welcome to Favorite Page" statement.

I configured error handlers:

1.  to handle the server error (status 500).
2.  to handle "page not found error" (status 404).
